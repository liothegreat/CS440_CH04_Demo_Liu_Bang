I have learned what is copyright and challenges fo new technology. I also knew the history about development of copyright law and some ethical arguments about what should be fair use. I have learned some problems of patents and some definitions of software licensing.
The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This license agreement is not a copyleft of the terms of the free software license agreement, which allows use in free and open source software or non-free software. The content of MIT can be changed according to the needs of the program copyright holder. The MIT license agreement can coexist with other license agreements. In addition, the MIT Terms and Conditions are also the terms of the Free Software License Agreement recognized by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and are compatible with the GPL. Therefore, Users can do whatever they want with my code if they have a copyright notice and a license notice in their copy of the project, and I don't have to take any responsibility.
